package updating
	+ re-test patch updating carefully
	+ ensure no packages overlap with patches etc.

pkcon remove glibc
	+ morphs the remove into an install (somehow)
	+ doesn't complain that we might destroy the system
	+ OTOH: doesn't destroy the system 

implement backend_download ...
	+ essentially an install with --download-only set to true.

NEWEST handling
	+ should move from backend_resolve_thread to
	+ zypp_emit_filtered_packages_in_list
		+ where it can be shared & more generic
		+ will require calculating 'newest' per package
		+ which would make that method more efficient anyway
